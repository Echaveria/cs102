"9","Socks","Amazon Essentials Women's Cotton Lightly Cushioned Crew Socks, 10 Pairs, Black, 4-7","Vic","The top of these socks is a smidge too tight for long term comfort (OK if you only wearing them for an hour or two). I'm not skinny-thin - but I kind of have regular sized ankles and size 4 feet. The length of the foot is slightly too long for me - but that's fine (most socks are too long) but i don't usually have issues with over tight tops.They are nice and soft though and have washed nicely.Update 17-11-2021 - a def con is how much black fluff they shed. If i go upstairs i leave fluff all over the biscuit coloured carpet. And, by bed time, all my toes have fluff between them. Downgraded to 2 stars, I'm afraid.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"
