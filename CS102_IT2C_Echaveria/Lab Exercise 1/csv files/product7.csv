"1","Socks","FM London Men's (12-Pack) Smart Breathable Socks, Black/Colour Heel & Toe, 6-11 UK (Pack of 12)","Wallace","I recently purchased the FM London 12-Pack socks, and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed. Firstly, the packaging was excellent, ensuring that my socks arrived in pristine condition.Upon trying them on, I was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable they are. The material is soft yet durable, providing a cozy fit that lasts throughout the day.One of the standout features for me is the variety of colors in the pack. It's a nice touch that allows me to add a pop of color to my outfits while still keeping things coordinated.Overall, I highly recommend the FM London 12-Pack socks. They're not only packed well and comfy but also offer a range of good colors to suit any style.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 February 2024","4.5 out of 5 stars"

"3","Socks","FM London Men's (12-Pack) Smart Breathable Socks, Black/Colour Heel & Toe, 6-11 UK (Pack of 12)","Wallace","These are comfortable socks, good for the price, hold their elasticity and shape even after washing several times.However, these are basic socks, which is reflected in the price. If you're walking a good deal, then expect them to go thin on the heel after several months. They also have a tendency to shed black specks which is a pain if you have carpet because your vacuum will struggle to pick them up when they quickly get tangled in the carpet threads.All in all, they're a decent sock though. A good bulk buy when you just need plenty of black cotton socks in the drawer for every day use. The toe and heel colours are useful to match them up after washing, and if one wears through it's no problem using pairs made of different colours...unless you're wearing them with sandals. And if THAT'S the case, your cred has already been shot and you might as well show you're wearing odd colours anyway. Enjoy.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 February 2024","3.0 out of 5 stars"

"5","Socks","FM London Men's (12-Pack) Smart Breathable Socks, Black/Colour Heel & Toe, 6-11 UK (Pack of 12)","Leah","I wanted something a little different to the usual black socks for everyday use. Let's face it, most socks will wear through at some point, some faster than others, so socks aren't exactly a long term purchase. Time will tell with these obviously but I love the stripey design and they fit my size 11 feet perfectly. They are soft and not tight so are a very comfortable fit for me, which isn't always the case with socks. The number of pairs (12) you receive is ridiculous for the price and if they are no worse wearing than any other sock I've had they will be an absolute bargain. They are not thick socks by any means and they are longer than your average black smart / work socks but so far am loving these. If they fall apart in 6 months then not so good, but so far there are none of the tell tale clicking sounds you get when socks are already straining at the seems.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

While these are not the softest socks, they seem to fit me well (size 10 feet) and so far have been very comfortable to wear. I prefer thin rather than thick socks.. if I was walking distances in boots etc I might buy specific walking socks.. but for everyday so far so good.. pleased with the quality and the price","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 March 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"

They're comfortable, soft and have a simple but good look to them. I like the feel of them, they are suitably warm and they go well with lots of different pairs of shoes. These are good value for money. Recommended.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
"9","Socks","FM London Men's (12-Pack) Smart Breathable Socks, Black/Colour Heel & Toe, 6-11 UK (Pack of 12)","Trefor","Well at under £11 for 12 pairs these certainly seem value for money. I am a size 10 and they fit fine are not tight and have plenty of stretch left in them - though that they fit me so well does have me wondering if they wouldn't be  little loose on a size 6?My only concern is that they do seem a little thin which on the one hand is probably great if you want summer socks that are not too hot - but on the other hand does make me wonder just how hard wearing they will be, which I guess only time will tell.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
