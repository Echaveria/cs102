"1","Pillows","Silentnight Airmax Pillow – Air Mesh Sides Maximising Airflow Preventing Overheating for a Cool Night's Sleep – Machine Washable and Hypoallergenic Bed Pillow, White","Rain Bow","I have bought pillows from Silentnight for years and have always been pleased with them.  Plus, I never keep my pillows long, every year or so I buy new.  This time around I thought I would try an ""upgrade"" to my usual model and I was pleased with the result.The Airmax Pillow has mesh around the sides.  This gives a good shape to the pillow, even when you lie on it, and is intended to let the pillow breathe and so keep your head cooler (I wait for summer to come so that I can test this feature more fully).  The pillow is hypoallergenic (something I always insist on when buying any kind of bedding), can be machine washed if need be, and comes with a 2 year guarantee which shows the confidence this manufacturer has in its product.Silentnight advises that for back sleepers you should select one pillow to sleep on that has a firmness rating, for front sleepers choose one pillow to sleep on that has a soft rating, for side sleepers  choose one or two pillows in the soft - medium rating.  The pillows I bought were in the soft rating but they are definitely not so soft that you sink into them - and I use 2 pillows on my bed for me.New pillows always seem to sit quite high and I know from experience that they will flatten down a little over time, so I am not concerned with that.  They are extremely comfortable to lie on and keep their shape throughout the night.  A little pat to fluff them up in the morning and they were back in perfect shape.I bought two pillows for this order and am pleased with the purchase - only a little more expensive than the model I have previously been buying but definitely worth the money.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 February 2024","4.2 out of 5 stars"

Don't get me wrong, I still have a bad shoulder, it's not a cure, but the comfort and support that it is providing me is enabling me to get a better nights sleep.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars"
