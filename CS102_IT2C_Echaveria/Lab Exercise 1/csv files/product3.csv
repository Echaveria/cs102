Elliott","The pillows turn up compressed to save space. I thought I could simply fluff the pillows up to get them back to their proper conditionThat doesn't fully work, so, I thought I had bought some very thin, hard pillowsI needed to use 2 pillows(I'm a side sleeper), but as the days progressed the pillows expanded, and became softer, so I ended up using only 1 after a weekSo, that all said, how are they?For me, pretty perfect - cool, firm enough to support my head and neck, but soft enough to be comfortableRecommended","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 March 2024","4.4 out of 5 stars"
"2","Pillow","Silentnight Deep Sleep Pillows 4 Pack - Medium Support Bed Pillows for Side, Front, Stomach and Back Sleepers Comfortable - Machine Washable and Hypoallergenic - Pack of 4","rubyslippers","The Silentnight Deep Sleep Firm Pillows have become a staple in my quest for a restful night's sleep. Offering firm support, these pillows are a commendable choice for those who appreciate a more structured and supportive feel during their slumber.The standout feature of these pillows is, without a doubt, the firmness. If you're seeking a pillow that doesn't flatten out under the weight of your head, these may be the ones for you. The firm support provides a noticeable lift, promoting a comfortable alignment for a variety of sleeping positions.The hypoallergenic filling is a reassuring aspect, especially for allergy-prone sleepers like myself. The pillows maintain their shape well, and the durable construction suggests they can withstand regular use without losing their supportive qualities.In terms of comfort, the pillows strike a balance. While the firmness is evident, they still manage to offer a certain level of softness. It's a pleasant middle ground that caters to individuals who prefer both support and a touch of plushness.The pillow covers are made from a soft and breathable material, enhancing the overall sleep experience. The two-pack provides convenience for those who like to switch out their pillows or have a spare for guests.However, it's worth noting that the firmness might not be suitable for everyone. If you prefer a softer, more malleable pillow, these might feel a bit too unyielding.In conclusion, the Silentnight Deep Sleep Firm Pillows deliver on their promise of firm support. While they may not be everyone's cup of tea, those who appreciate a more structured pillow will find these to be a reliable choice for a supportive and comfortable night's sleep.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"
