Offering firm support, these pillows are a commendable choice for those who appreciate a more structured and supportive feel during their slumber.The standout feature of these pillows is, without a doubt, the firmness. If you're seeking a pillow that doesn't flatten out under the weight of your head, these may be the ones for you. The firm support provides a noticeable lift, promoting a comfortable alignment for a variety of sleeping positions.The hypoallergenic filling is a reassuring aspect, especially for allergy-prone sleepers like myself. The pillows maintain their shape well, and the durable construction suggests they can withstand regular use without losing their supportive qualities.In terms of comfort, the pillows strike a balance. While the firmness is evident, they still manage to offer a certain level of softness. It's a pleasant middle ground that caters to individuals who prefer both support and a touch of plushness.The pillow covers are made from a soft and breathable material, enhancing the overall sleep experience. The two-pack provides convenience for those who like to switch out their pillows or have a spare for guests.However, it's worth noting that the firmness might not be suitable for everyone. If you prefer a softer, more malleable pillow, these might feel a bit too unyielding.In conclusion, the Silentnight Deep Sleep Firm Pillows deliver on their promise of firm support.

Offering firm support, these pillows are a commendable choice for those who appreciate a more structured and supportive feel during their slumber.The standout feature of these pillows is, without a doubt, the firmness. If you're seeking a pillow that doesn't flatten out under the weight of your head, these may be the ones for you. The firm support provides a noticeable lift, promoting a comfortable alignment for a variety of sleeping positions.The hypoallergenic filling is a reassuring aspect, especially for allergy-prone sleepers like myself. The pillows maintain their shape well, and the durable construction suggests they can withstand regular use without losing their supportive qualities.In terms of comfort, the pillows strike a balance. While the firmness is evident, they still manage to offer a certain level of softness. It's a pleasant middle ground that caters to individuals who prefer both support and a touch of plushness.The pillow covers are made from a soft and breathable material, enhancing the overall sleep experience. The two-pack provides convenience for those who like to switch out their pillows or have a spare for guests.However, it's worth noting that the firmness might not be suitable for everyone. If you prefer a softer, more malleable pillow, these might feel a bit too unyielding.In conclusion, the Silentnight Deep Sleep Firm Pillows deliver on their promise of firm support. While they may not be everyone's cup of tea, those who appreciate a more structured pillow will find these to be a reliable choice for a supportive and comfortable night's sleep.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Plus, I never keep my pillows long, every year or so I buy new.  This time around I thought I would try an ""upgrade"" to my usual model and I was pleased with the result.The Airmax Pillow has mesh around the sides.  This gives a good shape to the pillow, even when you lie on it, and is intended to let the pillow breathe and so keep your head cooler (I wait for summer to come so that I can test this feature more fully).  The pillow is hypoallergenic (something I always insist on when buying any kind of bedding), can be machine washed if need be, and comes with a 2 year guarantee which shows the confidence this manufacturer has in its product.Silentnight advises that for back sleepers you should select one pillow to sleep on that has a firmness rating, for front sleepers choose one pillow to sleep on that has a soft rating, for side sleepers  choose one or two pillows in the soft - medium rating.  The pillows I bought were in the soft rating but they are definitely not so soft that you sink into them - and I use 2 pillows on my bed for me.New pillows always seem to sit quite high and I know from experience that they will flatten down a little over time, so I am not concerned with that.

Plus, I never keep my pillows long, every year or so I buy new.  This time around I thought I would try an ""upgrade"" to my usual model and I was pleased with the result.The Airmax Pillow has mesh around the sides.  This gives a good shape to the pillow, even when you lie on it, and is intended to let the pillow breathe and so keep your head cooler (I wait for summer to come so that I can test this feature more fully).  The pillow is hypoallergenic (something I always insist on when buying any kind of bedding), can be machine washed if need be, and comes with a 2 year guarantee which shows the confidence this manufacturer has in its product.Silentnight advises that for back sleepers you should select one pillow to sleep on that has a firmness rating, for front sleepers choose one pillow to sleep on that has a soft rating, for side sleepers  choose one or two pillows in the soft - medium rating.  The pillows I bought were in the soft rating but they are definitely not so soft that you sink into them - and I use 2 pillows on my bed for me.New pillows always seem to sit quite high and I know from experience that they will flatten down a little over time, so I am not concerned with that.  They are extremely comfortable to lie on and keep their shape throughout the night.  A little pat to fluff them up in the morning and they were back in perfect shape.I bought two pillows for this order and am pleased with the purchase - only a little more expensive than the model I have previously been buying but definitely worth the money.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 February 2024","4.2 out of 5 stars"

If you're walking a good deal, then expect them to go thin on the heel after several months. They also have a tendency to shed black specks which is a pain if you have carpet because your vacuum will struggle to pick them up when they quickly get tangled in the carpet threads.All in all, they're a decent sock though. A good bulk buy when you just need plenty of black cotton socks in the drawer for every day use. The toe and heel colours are useful to match them up after washing, and if one wears through it's no problem using pairs made of different colours...unless you're wearing them with sandals. And if THAT'S the case, your cred has already been shot and you might as well show you're wearing odd colours anyway. Enjoy.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 February 2024","3.0 out of 5 stars"

Let's face it, most socks will wear through at some point, some faster than others, so socks aren't exactly a long term purchase. Time will tell with these obviously but I love the stripey design and they fit my size 11 feet perfectly. They are soft and not tight so are a very comfortable fit for me, which isn't always the case with socks. The number of pairs (12) you receive is ridiculous for the price and if they are no worse wearing than any other sock I've had they will be an absolute bargain. They are not thick socks by any means and they are longer than your average black smart / work socks but so far am loving these. If they fall apart in 6 months then not so good, but so far there are none of the tell tale clicking sounds you get when socks are already straining at the seems.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

They also have a tendency to shed black specks which is a pain if you have carpet because your vacuum will struggle to pick them up when they quickly get tangled in the carpet threads.All in all, they're a decent sock though. A good bulk buy when you just need plenty of black cotton socks in the drawer for every day use. The toe and heel colours are useful to match them up after washing, and if one wears through it's no problem using pairs made of different colours...unless you're wearing them with sandals. And if THAT'S the case, your cred has already been shot and you might as well show you're wearing odd colours anyway. Enjoy.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 February 2024","3.0 out of 5 stars"

Let's face it, most socks will wear through at some point, some faster than others, so socks aren't exactly a long term purchase. Time will tell with these obviously but I love the stripey design and they fit my size 11 feet perfectly. They are soft and not tight so are a very comfortable fit for me, which isn't always the case with socks. The number of pairs (12) you receive is ridiculous for the price and if they are no worse wearing than any other sock I've had they will be an absolute bargain. They are not thick socks by any means and they are longer than your average black smart / work socks but so far am loving these. If they fall apart in 6 months then not so good, but so far there are none of the tell tale clicking sounds you get when socks are already straining at the seems.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars"

Firstly, the packaging was excellent, ensuring that my socks arrived in pristine condition.Upon trying them on, I was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable they are.

It's a nice touch that allows me to add a pop of color to my outfits while still keeping things coordinated.Overall, I highly recommend the FM London 12-Pack socks.

Plus, I never keep my pillows long, every year or so I buy new.  This time around I thought I would try an ""upgrade"" to my usual model and I was pleased with the result.The Airmax Pillow has mesh around the sides.  This gives a good shape to the pillow, even when you lie on it, and is intended to let the pillow breathe and so keep your head cooler (I wait for summer to come so that I can test this feature more fully).  The pillow is hypoallergenic (something I always insist on when buying any kind of bedding), can be machine washed if need be, and comes with a 2 year guarantee which shows the confidence this manufacturer has in its product.Silentnight advises that for back sleepers you should select one pillow to sleep on that has a firmness rating, for front sleepers choose one pillow to sleep on that has a soft rating, for side sleepers  choose one or two pillows in the soft - medium rating.  The pillows I bought were in the soft rating but they are definitely not so soft that you sink into them - and I use 2 pillows on my bed for me.New pillows always seem to sit quite high and I know from experience that they will flatten down a little over time, so I am not concerned with that.  They are extremely comfortable to lie on and keep their shape throughout the night.

If you're walking a good deal, then expect them to go thin on the heel after several months. They also have a tendency to shed black specks which is a pain if you have carpet because your vacuum will struggle to pick them up when they quickly get tangled in the carpet threads.All in all, they're a decent sock though. A good bulk buy when you just need plenty of black cotton socks in the drawer for every day use. The toe and heel colours are useful to match them up after washing, and if one wears through it's no problem using pairs made of different colours...unless you're wearing them with sandals.

The number of pairs (12) you receive is ridiculous for the price and if they are no worse wearing than any other sock I've had they will be an absolute bargain.
